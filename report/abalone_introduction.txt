Introduction


Abalone are marine mollusks that are commercially important in fisheries and aquaculture, particularly in regions such as Tasmania. Estimating the age structure of abalone populations is essential for setting sustainable harvest limits and monitoring stock health. However, the standard method for determining age requires cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting growth rings under a microscope—a destructive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive procedure[1]. Because of this, methods that can infer age from simple, non-destructive measurements of the animal are of practical interest to biologists, fisheries managers, and growers.


Here, we ask whether we can use a machine learning model to predict the age of an abalone from basic physical measurements. Specifically, we will explore linear regression models in Python to relate age to various attributes, including sex, shell length, diameter, height, and several weight measurements. To investigate this question, we use the UCI Abalone dataset, which contains 4,177 abalones with eight predictor variables and a target variable, “Rings.” Each row corresponds to one abalone, and the recorded features include sex (male, female, infant), three shell size measurements (length, diameter, height), and four weight measurements (whole, shucked, viscera, and shell weight). The number of rings serves as a proxy for age, with age in years given approximately by Rings + 1.5[2]. By building and evaluating linear regression models on this dataset, we aim to understand how well these readily obtained physical measurements can predict abalone age and what this implies for practical, non-destructive age estimation.
